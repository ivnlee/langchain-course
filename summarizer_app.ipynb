            "The initial entry point for the multi-stage attack is SMS phishing, in which the threat actor employs various scare tactics to trick unwitting recipients into clicking on bogus landing pages to harvest and exfiltrate their credentials via a Telegram bot.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"The phishing pages were meticulously set up using Neo_Net's panels, PRIV8, and implemented multiple defense measures, including blocking requests from non-mobile user agents and concealing the pages from bots and network scanners,\" Thill explained.\n",

            "\n",
            "The Ankarex platform, for its part, has been active since May 2022. It's actively promoted on a Telegram channel that has about 1,700 subscribers.\n",
